(a) FIND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE NUMBER – CHECKPOLARITY.CPP

AIM:

To check whether a given number is positive or negative using conditional statements in C++.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Conditional statements in C++ allow the program to make decisions based on conditions. The if, if-else, and else if constructs are used to execute code selectively. By checking whether a number is greater than, less than, or equal to zero, the program can determine its polarity.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare a variable to store the number.

Accept user input for the number.

Use if-else to check:

If number > 0 → Positive

Else if number < 0 → Negative

Else → Zero

Display the result.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully identifies whether a number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.

(b) TO FIND COORDINATES ARE FROM WHICH QUADRANT – COORDINATES.CPP

AIM:

To determine in which quadrant a given point (x, y) lies.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

The Cartesian coordinate system divides the plane into four quadrants: Quadrant I: x > 0, y > 0; Quadrant II: x < 0, y > 0; Quadrant III: x < 0, y < 0; Quadrant IV: x > 0, y < 0. If x = 0 or y = 0, the point lies on an axis or at the origin. Conditional statements are used to identify the correct quadrant.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare variables for x and y coordinates.

Accept user input for x and y.

Use conditional statements to check Quadrant I, II, III, IV, or axis/origin.

Display the quadrant or position of the point.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully identifies the quadrant or axis location of a point using conditional statements.

(c) ENTER LAST 5 DIGITS OF YOUR PRN AND PRINT EACH DIGIT IN REVERSE – PRNINREVERSE.CPP

AIM:

To reverse the digits of a 5-digit integer and print each digit on a separate line.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

A number can be reversed by repeatedly extracting its last digit using the modulus operator (%) and integer division (/). Conditional statements and loops help process each digit sequentially.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare a variable for the 5-digit number.

Accept user input for the number.

Use a loop to extract digits from last to first:

last_digit = number % 10

number = number / 10

print last_digit

Repeat until all digits are printed.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints the digits of a 5-digit number in reverse order using loops and conditional logic.

(d) CALCULATE STUDENT’S GRADE – GRADE.CPP

AIM:

To calculate a student’s grade based on marks using conditional statements.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Grades are determined by evaluating the marks obtained and comparing them to predefined ranges using if-else statements: Distinction, First Class, Second Class, Pass, Fail. Conditional statements ensure correct grade allocation based on score ranges.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare variables for marks.

Accept marks as input from the user.

Use if-else statements to assign grades based on ranges.

Display the calculated grade.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully calculates and displays the grade of a student based on entered marks using conditional statements.


uccessfully calculates and displays the grade of a student based on entered marks using conditional statements.
